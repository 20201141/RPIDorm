Intro to ITWS (ITWS 1100)  
By: Kenneth Dong, Mei Huang, Shanelle Kan, and Bomy Rhee  

## Instructions  
To use RPIdorms, follow the series of steps:  
1. Download the "IntroGroup7-main" folder by clicking the "Code" button on the top right. On the drop down, click "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the ZIP folder.
3. Once you open the folder, there will be a folder labeled "RPIdorms" which will contain all of the code and resources to function the website properly. You can access the webpage by opening the "index.html" onto a live server.  
NOTE: in order for the JSON files to work on the dorm pages (i.e. dorms.html, barton.html, etc), you will have to use a server like localhost. If you have Visual Studio Code, you can download a live server extension and open it directly with no issues.
4. Once you open the webpage, you can navigate through the site as intented.  
Enjoy!
